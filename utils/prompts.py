You are an intelligent input processor for a bedtime story generator for kids aged 5-10.

Analyze this user input: "{user_input}"

Determine if this is a meaningful story request by considering:
- Does it contain story elements (characters, settings, actions, themes)?
- Is it coherent enough to build a bedtime story around?
- Could this realistically come from someone wanting a story?

EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:
- Random gibberish like "sdfdfgg" = INVALID
- Single words like "dragon" = VALID (expand to "A story about a dragon")
- Inappropriate content = INVALID (gently redirect)
- Very vague like "something fun" = VALID (can work with this)
- Copyrighted characters like "Spider-Man" = VALID but replace with "a superhero"

If VALID: Extract and enhance the core story elements into a clear story request.
If INVALID: Provide a gentle, encouraging re-prompt with a specific example.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON:
{{
    "valid": true/false,
    "story_elements": "enhanced story request (empty if invalid)",
    "suggestion": "encouraging re-prompt with example (empty if valid)"
}}

Examples:
Input: "sdfdfgg" → {{"valid": false, "story_elements": "", "suggestion": "I didn't quite catch that! Try something like: 'A story about a friendly robot who learns to paint'"}}

Input: "dragon" → {{"valid": true, "story_elements": "A story about a dragon", "suggestion": ""}}

Input: "my cat died" → {{"valid": false, "story_elements": "", "suggestion": "Let's create something happy for bedtime! How about: 'A story about a cat who goes on a magical adventure'?"}}

    @staticmethod
    def complete_story_prompt(story_request: str) -> str:
        return f"""
You are writing a bedtime story that creates a calm environment to help children relax and drift into peaceful sleep.

REQUEST: "{story_request}"

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE REQUEST
First, think about:
- What gentle theme fits this request? (kindness, friendship, helping, family, gentle exploration)
- What type of calming story works best? (friendship bonding, gentle discovery, helping others, cozy adventure)
- What familiar setting would be most comforting? (home, garden, forest, library, neighborhood)
- Who should be the gentle main character and what endearing trait do they have?

STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR BEDTIME STORY STRUCTURE

GENTLE FRIENDSHIP: Character feels lonely → meets kind helpers → they share something special → bond through caring → cozy together

HELPING STORY: Character finds someone who needs help → gathers caring friends → work together kindly → everyone feels better → peaceful satisfaction

COZY DISCOVERY: Character finds something interesting → shares discovery with friends → explore together gently → learn something wonderful → settle down content

GENTLE ADVENTURE: Character wants to find something → meets helpful friends → journey together safely → find what they sought → rest together happily

STEP 3: BEDTIME STORY ESSENTIALS

Your story must balance gentle engagement with deep relaxation:

SOOTHING LANGUAGE PROGRESSION:
Opening: Warm, welcoming tone - "Maya loved," "friends gathered," "they discovered"
Middle: Gentle cooperation - "softly helped," "kindly shared," "peacefully worked together"  
Ending: Lullaby-like calm - "quietly settled," "drifted contentedly," "slept peacefully"

CALMING CHARACTER INTERACTIONS:
- Main character has one gentle, endearing trait (organizes things by color, hums while working, gives warm hugs)
- 2-3 helper characters who are immediately kind and welcoming
- All characters show patience, understanding, and genuine care for each other
- Dialogue reveals warmth: "I'd love to help!" "That sounds wonderful!" "We make a great team!"

PEACEFUL PACING:
- Unfold story gently without rushing or pressure
- Use familiar, safe settings that instill comfort
- Build through cooperation and mutual care, not conflict
- Resolve through friendship and kindness, creating feelings of safety and love

STEP 4: WRITING REQUIREMENTS

FORMAT: Write 8-10 scenes of 150-200 words each. Target 1200-1500 total words. Use \\n\\n between scenes.

SCENE DEVELOPMENT - NO RUSHING ALLOWED:
Scene 1: Character in familiar setting, show their gentle trait through specific actions (150-200 words)
Scene 2: Gentle situation unfolds slowly, show character's thoughts and feelings (150-200 words)
Scene 3: Meet first helper - show what they're doing, full conversation, personality revealed (200+ words)
Scene 4: First helper joins journey, more dialogue showing their unique way of helping (150-200 words)  
Scene 5: Meet second helper - again, show their activity, full conversation, distinct personality (200+ words)
Scene 6: All characters work together, each contributing uniquely with dialogue throughout (200+ words)
Scene 7: Peaceful resolution with characters sharing meaningful moments together (150-200 words)
Scene 8: Extended cozy ending with characters bonding and preparing for rest (150-200 words)

DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS - BRING CHARACTERS TO LIFE:
Each helper character must have:
- 6-8 lines of dialogue minimum showing their unique personality
- Distinct way of speaking that reveals who they are
- Personal sharing about themselves or their interests
- Natural conversations that build real connections
- Realistic reactions and responses to other characters

CHARACTER DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
Show each character:
- What they're doing when first encountered (be specific)
- How they react to meeting others (show their personality)
- What makes them unique (speech patterns, interests, habits)
- How they contribute their special talents to helping
- Personal moments of connection with main character

EXPANDED INTERACTION SCENES:
Instead of "they met Luna who offered to help" write:
"Perched on a low branch, Luna was carefully arranging fallen leaves into neat piles by size. Her feathers were a soft brown with silver tips that caught the moonlight. When she heard footsteps, she looked up with bright amber eyes. 'Oh my! Hello there,' Luna hooted gently. 'I was just organizing these leaves - I can't help myself, everything looks better when it's tidy. Are you two lost? I know every tree and path in this forest.' Drake smiled, feeling an instant connection with someone else who loved organizing. 'We're looking for this little one's family,' he explained, holding up the squirrel. Luna's expression immediately grew warm and concerned. 'Of course I'll help! Family is the most important thing. I have three little owlets of my own, and I would want someone to help them if they were lost.'"

SOUL AND EMOTION REQUIREMENTS:
Show characters:
- Genuinely caring about each other's wellbeing
- Sharing personal details that create real bonds
- Having small moments of understanding and connection
- Learning something meaningful from each interaction
- Growing closer through their shared journey

PACING RULE:
Take your time with each scene. Don't rush to the next plot point. Let conversations develop naturally. Show characters getting to know each other gradually.

BEDTIME LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use rhythmic, melodic phrases that flow like a lullaby
- Include gentle repetition that soothes: "softly," "gently," "peacefully"
- Choose warm, soft words over sharp or harsh sounds
- End with cozy imagery: soft grass, warm starlight, gentle breezes, comfortable nests

FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS:
- Any scary, intense, or stimulating situations
- Conflicts or disagreements between characters
- Time pressure, deadlines, or urgent problems
- Chase scenes, loud noises, or exciting action
- AI phrases: "heart filled with," "magical bond," "shimmered with"
- Unresolved problems or stimulating endings

POSITIVE SLEEP PREPARATION:
Your ending must show characters feeling completely safe, loved, and content - mirroring the peaceful state children should feel as they drift toward sleep.

CRITICAL SCORING GUIDELINES:

Question: "Are there other dragons in the library?"
Answer: "Maybe there are! Luna seemed like she had been hiding for a long time, so perhaps there are other shy magical creatures living quietly among the books, waiting for kind friends like Maya to discover them."
