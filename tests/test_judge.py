One evening, as the sun was setting and casting golden light through the tall windows, she discovered something magical. Behind the dusty astronomy books lived Luna, a small purple dragon who organized books by the colors of their covers. Luna was shy and had been hiding from people for years, but she was also very lonely. Maya wasn't scared at all - she thought Luna was the most wonderful thing she'd ever seen. 'Would you like to be friends?' Maya asked gently. Luna's eyes sparkled with joy. Together, they spent the evening arranging books in rainbow patterns and sharing stories about far-away planets and friendly aliens. As the library grew quiet and peaceful, Luna showed Maya a cozy reading nook with soft cushions where she liked to curl up. 'This is my favorite spot for dreaming,' Luna whispered. Maya promised to visit again soon. As Maya walked home under the twinkling stars, she felt happy knowing she had made such a special friend. That night, she drifted off to sleep thinking about all the magical stories she and Luna would discover together.",

Tommy's car flipped three times but he was okay! The race wasn't over yet! He had to catch up! More cars crashed and there was smoke everywhere!
